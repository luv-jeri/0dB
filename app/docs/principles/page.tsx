          A line that runs too long loses the eye on its way back to the next one, and a line that runs too short breaks the sentence before it can breathe. Somewhere between them the
          reading goes quiet: you stop noticing the lines and only hear what they say. 0nlyType sets its body text there, at sixty-two characters, and leaves the rest of the page to space.
