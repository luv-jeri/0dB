# 0dB: the component library and its own docs

Date: 2026-09-30. Status: approved in conversation, section by section. The owner then asked to proceed without further questions.

## Intent

0dB (formerly Fermata) becomes a shadcn registry library in the shape of 000h by Cojeev. Its docs site is built only from 0dB's own components; there is no Fumadocs. When the docs need a component that doesn't exist, it's built and added to the library. The repo is `github.com/luv-jeri/0dB`, and it's hosted at `https://0db.cojeev.com`.

Done means all of these hold:
1. `npx shadcn add https://0db.cojeev.com/r/<name>.json` installs a component into a fresh Next app. The app builds, and the component looks and behaves like the specimen.
2. Every page of the docs site is made from 0dB components plus page-level layout CSS.
3. INTENT.md and DESIGN.md exist, and the drift check holds them to the code.
4. `npm run check` passes locally and in CI, and the site is deployed.

Decisions already made (don't re-derive them):
- The name is **0dB**.
- The host is 0db.cojeev.com, on Cloudflare static assets.
- One spec covers everything.
- Primitives follow approach **A**: native where the specimen is native, and Radix or cmdk only for menus, overlays that float, the combobox and command.

## 1. Repo layout

```

## 2. Naming

- **Tokens** go from `--f-*` to `--db-*`. **Classes** go from `f-<name>` to `db-<name>`. **Keyframes** go from `f-*` to `db-*`. Tailwind has no `db-` utilities, so nothing clashes.
- **Registry item names** use shadcn's name where shadcn has that component; otherwise they use the specimen's word. The CSS class keeps the poster name. For example, the item `slider` exports `Slider`, which renders `.db-ruler`.
- **The namespace** is `@0db`. The base item is `0db`.

## 3. The registry

- **The base item `0db`** (`registry:base`):
  - files: `tokens.css`, `base.css`, `fonts.css` and `lib/utils.ts`
  - dependencies: clsx and tailwind-merge
  - `css` imports its three files
  - `cssVars.theme`, which maps tokens for Tailwind v4 through `@theme inline` (`--color-paper: var(--db-paper)` …)
  - `@custom-variant dark` on `[data-mode=nocturne]`
- **base.css holds:**
  - the reset and globals: selection, focus, mark, hr, `[hidden]`, scrollbars
  - the shared keyframes: `db-arrive`, `db-land`, `db-draw-x`, `db-draw-y`
  - the type roles (`db-pp` … `db-ffff`, `db-yours`, `db-term`, `db-label`, `db-figures`, `db-sr`)
  - the base pieces (link, meta, kbd, corners, fraction), because other fences style through them

  It's wrapped in `@layer base`. Component sidecars are wrapped in `@layer components`, so Tailwind utilities still override them.
- **fonts.css** is the default pair, Parma (Archivo variable with the wdth and wght axes, and Bodoni Moda variable in roman and italic). It's Latin-subset woff2, embedded as data URIs like 000h, so no files have to be placed in `public/`. The other three pairs are optional items: `fonts-press`, `fonts-paris` and `fonts-salon`. The OFL notices ship with the base.
- **Component items** (`registry:ui`) consist of `ui/<item>.tsx` plus `styles/<item>.css`, which is installed to `styles/0db/<item>.css` and added through the item's `css` `@import`, exactly as in 000h.
  - `registryDependencies` is the base URL plus the URL of any sibling item it imports or whose CSS it relies on.
  - npm `dependencies` are derived from the item's imports.
- **Imports are rewritten at build time:** `@/registry/0db/ui/x` becomes `@/components/ui/x`, and `@/registry/0db/lib/utils` becomes `@/lib/utils`.
- **The base URL** is `https://0db.cojeev.com`, and it can be overridden by `DB_REGISTRY_URL` for local install checks.

## 4. Components

The shape every item follows:
- `ui/<item>.tsx` with React 19 (a ref is a plain prop, so no `forwardRef`).
- `"use client"` only where state, effects or Radix require it.
- A root class `db-<name>`, plus `className` merged through `cn`.
- `data-slot` on the root and each part.
- Native props passed straight through.

**Variants are `data-variant` and `data-size` attributes, not cva.** The specimen's CSS keys on those attributes, so the sidecar stays the specimen's CSS. This changes Section 2, as approved in chat, and the reason is recorded here. `Button` supports `asChild` through `@radix-ui/react-slot`.

The rules every item keeps, and the item enforces them rather than the consumer:
- **Ours in roman, yours in italic.** Whatever a person typed or chose renders in the expression face.
- **One accent per view.** The accent only marks what's current, selected or focused.
- **Nothing moves unless the person acts.** Reduced motion makes every articulation instant.
- **No icons, cards or shadows.**
- Logical properties throughout, with `:dir(rtl)` where a stroke has a direction.

**What sits underneath:**
- **Native:** the element carries the state, and the CSS reads `:checked`, `[open]` and `[aria-*]`.
- **Hook:** the specimen's script, ported to a small React hook inside the item's file.
- **Radix and cmdk:** the CSS reads `[data-state]` instead of `:popover-open`. Radix does the positioning (`side`, `align`, `sideOffset`), and the CSS anchor positioning is dropped for these items.

The dependency column is a starting point. The real list is derived from each item's imports, plus any class or keyframe it borrows from another sidecar.

**The three new items:**
- **steps:** a numbered `<ol>`. The numbers are a real sequence, set as large roman figures in the margin, with the current step in accent.
- **source:** a code block. Strings are italic (what someone wrote), comments are pencil, keywords are roman ink, and there's no second colour. The Copy action is a bracket button, and the toast reads "Copied."
- **CommandDialog:** the ⌘K palette. It takes the item off "Skipped for now".

## 5. The docs site

- Next 16 App Router, `output: "export"`, `trailingSlash: true`.
- Tailwind v4 is imported the way a consumer would, so compatibility is exercised on every build.
- Scrolling is the browser's own. Lenis smooth scrolling was removed by owner decision on 2026-10-10: the page kept gliding 0.7 to 0.9 s after the wheel stopped (native stops in about 0.03 s), and it ran every scroll on the main thread, which dragged on heavy pages. Items keep their `data-lenis-prevent` marks for people who add a smooth scroller to their own app.
- The theme (mode, scheme, key, pair) is restored from `localStorage` by an inline script in `<head>` before first paint.

**Pages:**
- `/`: the overture. The "0dB" wordmark exhales along its wdth axis, and the pretext manifesto flows around the dot. The principles follow.
- `/docs/`: the index. Items are listed as `rows`, grouped by movement.
- `/docs/<item>/`: one page per item.
- `/docs/install/`: `steps` plus `source`.
- `/docs/tokens/`: click a token to copy it.
- `/docs/principles/`: the principles.
- `/specimen/`: the original page, copied as it is.

**The frame:**
- The margin holds the sidebar, which becomes a `sheet` on narrow screens.
- The stave holds the content.
- The fixed top row shows the current movement and holds the controls (`picks` and `select` for scheme, pair and key; `switch` for Nocturne) and the ⌘K trigger.
- The page `scrollbar` rail marks every section, so it's the table of contents.

**An item page, top to bottom:**
1. The name in `db-fff`, with its summary.
2. The live `Example` inside `corners`, then `States` when the example exports it.
3. Install: `tabs` (CLI or manual) with `source`.
4. Usage: the example file's source, with imports shown as `@/components/ui/…`.
5. The DESIGN.md contract, rendered from the markdown at build time: anatomy, keyboard and notes.
6. Props as a `table`, from `content/<item>.ts`.
7. The item's rows from "Where each move comes from" and "Motion".
8. Previous and next as `pagination`.

**`content/<item>.ts`** exports:
- `name`, `title` and `movement` (a Roman numeral)
- `contract`, meaning the class that heads its DESIGN.md contract, e.g. `db-btn`
- `summary`, one sentence
- `underneath`: native, hook, radix or cmdk
- `props`: `{ name, type, default?, description }[]`

**Search:** `CommandDialog` over a static index of items, tokens and pages. cmdk does the matching.

## 6. INTENT.md and DESIGN.md

- **INTENT.md** is one page: the name, who it's for, what success looks like, what it refuses and why, its non-goals, and what to do when in doubt.
- **DESIGN.md** is the renamed spec, reorganised as:
  1. principles, tokens and the shape vocabulary
  2. one contract per item, headed `### db-<class> (<item>)` and naming what sits underneath
  3. "Where each move comes from" and "Motion"
  4. registry conventions and docs conventions
  5. "Skipped for now"

## 7. Checks

`npm run check` runs, and CI runs the same thing:
1. **`typecheck` and `lint`:** eslint with zero warnings. It also fails on any `!important` in the registry CSS, except the allowlisted `[hidden]` and `db-sr` rules in base.css.
2. **`check:registry`:** a rebuild must produce the committed `registry.json` and `public/r/*.json` byte for byte.
3. **`check:drift`:** every item has `ui`, `content` and `examples` files and a DESIGN.md contract, and every `--db-*` token used in the registry CSS is defined in tokens.css.
4. **`check:examples`:** every example compiles with `tsc` after its imports are rewritten the way a consumer's would be.
5. **`check:install`:** a scratch Next app, with the registry served locally, runs `shadcn add` for every item, and then `next build` passes.
6. **`check:pages`:** Playwright opens every page of the export at 375px and 1440px. It fails on console errors or sideways overflow.

A one-time browser pass at the end, done manually, covers:
- the look against the specimen, in Day and Nocturne
- the keyboard on the Radix and cmdk items
- reduced motion
- ⌘K

## 8. Deploy

- **Hosting:** `wrangler.jsonc` serves static assets from `out/`, with the custom domain `0db.cojeev.com` and a 404 page. `public/_headers` sets the security headers, plus `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on `/r/*`.
- **CI:** it runs check and build on pull requests and pushes. On `main`, it deploys with `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (a repo secret the owner adds). If the secret is missing, the step skips and says so.
- **Git:** work happens on `library`, with a draft pull request into `main` titled "DO NOT MERGE — needs Sanjay".

## Skipped (and why)

- **A beta environment:** there are no outside users yet.
- **Submitting to the shadcn directory:** it's a public pull request on another repo, so the entry is drafted at `docs/directory-entry.json` for the owner to send.
- **cva:** see §4.
- **The motion library and icon set:** the CSS already does the articulations, and icons are refused.
