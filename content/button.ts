The heroes: overture swells from light to heavy and ends in a full stop; crescendo opens a hairpin under the word as the word swells a weight; stave sets the word in italic between two staves that run out to the edges; ink is an outlined block that fills from the side you came in. The measures: space spreads the words across the whole line, and pointing gathers them at its end while the silence they leave becomes the arrow that leads to them; repeat sets the word between repeat signs, for doing something again, and pointing sets the opening dots." },
